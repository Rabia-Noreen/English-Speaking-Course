### Parts of a Predicate

1. **Verb** (Main Part of the Predicate):
   - The core of the predicate is the verb, which tells what the subject is doing or what state the subject is in.
   - Example: "The boy ran."
     - In this sentence, "ran" is the verb and it tells what the boy did.

2. **Objects**:
   - **Direct Object**: A noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb directly.
     - Example: "She kicked the ball."
     - In this sentence, "ball" is the direct object because it receives the action of the verb "kicked."

   - Example: "The cat is sleeping on the sofa."
     - Subject: The cat
     - Predicate: is sleeping on the sofa
