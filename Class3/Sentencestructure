# Sentence Structure

## Subject + Predicate

### S + V + O
S(Subject) + Predicate (Verb + Object)

### Parts of a Predicate

1. **Verb (Main Part of the Predicate):**
   - The core of the predicate is the verb, which tells what the subject is doing or what state the subject is in.
   - **Example:**
     - The boy ran.
     - In this sentence, "ran" is the verb, and it tells what the boy did.

2. **Objects:**
   - **Direct Object**: A noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb directly.
     - **Example**: "She **kicked** the **ball**."
     - In this sentence, "ball" is the direct object because it receives the action of the verb "kicked."

The predicate, in all its forms, helps complete the meaning of a sentence by providing necessary details about the subject's action, state, or identity.

### Key Points:

1. **Subject**: The part of the sentence that tells who or what the sentence is about.
2. **Predicate**: The part of the sentence that tells something about the subject.

### Examples:

1. **Simple Predicate**: Consists only of the verb or verb phrase.
   - **Example**: "She runs."
     - **Subject**: She
     - **Predicate**: runs (This is a simple predicate containing only the verb.)
  
2. **Complete Predicate**: Includes the verb and all the words related to the verb.
   - **Example**: "The cat is sleeping on the sofa."
     - **Subject**: The cat
     - **Complete Predicate**: is sleeping on the sofa (This includes the verb "is sleeping" and the additional information "on the sofa.")

3. **Compound Predicate**: When two or more verbs share the same subject.
   - **Example**: "He bought a book and read it."
     - **Subject**: He
     - **Compound Predicate**: bought a book and read it (This includes two verbs: "bought" and "read.")
