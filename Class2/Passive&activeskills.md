### Passive Skills
In language learning, passive skills consist of **listening** and **reading**.

---

### Active Skills
The productive skills are **speaking** and **writing** because learners doing these need to produce language. They are also known as **active skills**.

### What is a Sentence?
A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It typically consists of two main parts: the **subject** and the **predicate**.

---

### Sentence and Its Parts
1. **Subject**: The subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing, or idea that is performing the action or being described. It tells us "who" or "what" the sentence is about.

    - Example: _The cat is sleeping._

2. **Predicate**: The predicate contains the verb and tells something about the subject, such as what the subject is doing or what is being done to the subject. It usually includes the verb and the object (if any).

    - Example: _The cat is sleeping._

---

### Detailed Explanation
Every sentence is made up of two parts:
1. **Subject**: The person or thing being discussed, described, or dealt with.
2. **Predicate**: The part that says something about the subject.

### Examples
#### Noun:
**Ram is running fast.**  
- Ram is the subject, and "is running fast" is the predicate.

#### Pronoun:
**He has no money in his pocket.**  
- "He" is the subject, and "has no money in his pocket" is the predicate.

#### Noun Phrase:
**The cackling of geese saved Rome.**  
- "The cackling of geese" is the subject, and "saved Rome" is the predicate.

#### Imperative Sentences:
In imperative sentences, the subject is by default "you."

- Example: **Sit down.**  
  - In this case, "you" is the implied subject, and "sit down" is the predicate.
