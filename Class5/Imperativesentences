# Imperative Sentences for Beginners

## Definition
An imperative sentence gives a command, makes a request, or offers advice. These sentences are often used to tell someone what to do or not to do. They usually start with a verb and do not have a subject because the subject is usually "you," which is understood.

### Key Points
- Imperative sentences can be **positive** (telling someone to do something) or **negative** (telling someone not to do something).
- They can end with a **period (.)** or an **exclamation mark (!)** depending on the tone (calm or strong).

### Structure:
1. **Verb + Object**
   - The subject (you) is implied and not mentioned.

### Examples:
#### Positive Imperative Sentences:
- Sit down.
- Open the door.
- Please pass the salt.
- Turn off the light.
- Write your name on the paper.

#### Negative Imperative Sentences:
- Don’t run in the hallway.
- Don’t touch the stove.
- Don’t speak loudly.
- Do not forget your homework.
- Don’t be late.

### When to Use Imperative Sentences:
- **To give commands**: "Close the window."
- **To make requests**: "Please help me with this."
- **To offer advice**: "Take your time."
- **To give directions**: "Turn right at the corner."

## My Daily Routine
I start my day at 5 a.m., waking up early to offer prayers. After that, I review the lecture I'm going to deliver at the university. Following my revision, I have breakfast and then head to the university by auto.

At the university, I deliver my lecture and manage various tasks on the LMS, including marking attendance, grading assignments, and working on the portal. After completing my academic duties, I return home, have lunch, and take a short nap for about an hour.

In the evening, I conduct online lectures for some of my students and dedicate time to learning Python and AI skills. I also conduct sessions with students from Learning Junction, followed by another round of self-study to deepen my AI knowledge.
