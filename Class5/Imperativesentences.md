# My Daily Routine

I start my day at 5 a.m., waking up early to offer prayers. After that, I review the lecture I'm going to deliver at the university. Following my revision, I have breakfast and then head to the university by auto.

At the university, I deliver my lecture and manage various tasks on the LMS, including marking attendance, grading assignments, and working on the portal. After completing my academic duties, I return home, have lunch, and take a short nap for about an hour.

In the evening, I conduct online lectures for some of my students and dedicate time to learning Python and AI skills. I also conduct sessions with students from Learning Junction followed by another round of self-study to deepen my AI knowledge.

# Imperative Sentences for Beginners

## Definition

An *imperative sentence* gives a command, makes a request, or offers advice. These sentences are often used to tell someone what to do or not to do. They usually start with a verb and do not have a subject because the subject is usually "you," which is understood.

### Key Points
- Imperative sentences can be **positive** (telling someone to do something) or **negative** (telling someone not to do something).
- They can end with a *period (.)* or an *exclamation mark (!)* depending on the tone (calm or strong).

### Structure:
1. Verb + Object  
   *(The subject (you) is implied and not mentioned)*

### Examples:

1. **Positive Imperative Sentences**:
   - Sit down.
   - Open the door.
   - Please pass the salt.
   - Turn off the light.
   - Write your name on the paper.

2. **Negative Imperative Sentences**:
   - Don’t run in the hallway.
   - Don’t touch the stove.
   - Don’t speak loudly.
   - Do not forget your homework.
   - Don’t be late.

## When to Use Imperative Sentences:
- To give commands: *"Close the window."*
- To make requests: *"Please help me with this."*
- To offer advice: *"Take your time."*
- To give directions: *"Turn right at the corner."*
