## What is a Sentence?

A *sentence* is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. It typically consists of two main parts: the *subject* and the *predicate*.

- **Subject**: The subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing, or idea that is performing the action or being described. It tells us "who" or "what" the sentence is about.
   - Example: The cat is sleeping.

- **Predicate**: The predicate contains the verb and tells something about the subject, such as what the subject is doing or what is being done to the subject. It usually includes the verb and the object (if any).
   - Example: The cat is sleeping.
